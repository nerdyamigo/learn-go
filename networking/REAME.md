# Applied Networking Using Golang

## Protocol Layers
In distributed systems, the parts are called protocol and they clearly defined functions. They form a stack, witch each layer communicating with the
layer above and the layer below. The communication between layers is defined by protocols. 

Network communications required protocols to cover high-level application communication all the way down to the wire communication and the complexity
handled by encapsulation in protocol layers
